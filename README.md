# Bayesian-Regression-and-Gaussian-Mixture-Model-for-Classification
linear regression in Bayesian setting as a base model and explored possibility of Gaussian mixture model

In this project, I aim to explore the regression analysis on a specific dataset from the Bayesian
stand point. The data consists of observational records and label variable measure under
traditional approach for abalone, a common seashore living creature. The goal is to establish a
model to predict the age of abalone with the observational predictors.
